# University Assignment: Test Cases, Control Flow Graph, Mutation Test, and Test Path Coverage

# Overview
This repository contains my work for the university assignment where I explored various testing concepts and tools related to Java development. The main topics covered are:

# Test Cases: Writing effective test cases to validate the functionality of Java code.
# Control Flow Graph (CFG): Analyzing the control flow within the code to identify potential paths.
# Mutation Testing: Evaluating the robustness of test suites by introducing artificial defects.
# Test Path Coverage: Ensuring comprehensive coverage of different execution paths.
##Technologies Used
Java: The programming language used for the assignment.
JUnit: The testing framework for writing and executing test cases.
JaCoCo: A code coverage tool to measure test coverage.
